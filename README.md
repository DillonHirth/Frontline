# Frontline

## What is Frontline
Frontline is a simple, forever free, open source, brawler style card game. The point is to accomplish what other games like 
hearthstone, gwent, and runeterra do in a simpler and more portable fashion.
Something that can be played easily and quickly with just one or two normal decks of playing cards. 

### Problems I hope to have creative solutions for
Many of the previous card games I listed above share some common problems.
1. Money, they all require some form of investment either money or time to be competitive. 
2. generally either first or second player has an advantage. Runeterra I think had a fun balancing choice for this, but the issue still mostly remained.
3. you can't really play any of them without a PC. What about magic you say? well, I know the first problem still holds true for that one.

So, I want to be clear, the above games are all great in their respective rights, and I have enjoyed them immensely.
I am just hoping to create something simpler, and more pocket sized that can be played in person with 2 to 4 players.
So here are my current solutions:
1. Should be playable with 2 standard 52 card decks, hopefully even 1. 
2. I call it frontline because I would like it to play out like two armies meeting in battle, where they each get the same information at the same time, and then have a chance to try and
respond to that new information with a resolving round after to determine the outcome. 
3. This should be playable with a standard deck, but I thought it would be fun to turn this into a project. 

### Rules<sub>(very early outline, subject to change) </sub>
years of thoughts in my head I need to write down
1. Draw a hand of 7-10 cards, then determine your point total, draw until you are equal to or just past a certain point, i.e. 70points. 
2. draw support(face cards) from a seperate deck containing only face cards
3. 'deploy' your army face down, 4 cards wide? maybe 2 rows
4. flip your army cards over
5. now, instead of taking turns to lay down support/reinforcement. each player lays them face down whenever, and however many they desire.
the trick here, is to have diverse enough support cards, to allow for feints, so when they see a weak column get reinforced, they wont know if its a really good 
support card, or a simple 2card to draw out there reinforcements etc. much like gwent, I hope it will be a fun balance and tactical gambit of where and who to reinforce
6. flip over the support/reinforcements
7. resolve the first battle
8. depending on support cards, some may possibly stay on the field, but essentially, there may be a small draw again of 1 support card and a couple normal cards, with a mulligan/redraw
followed by another round or two of battles. 


veteran cards? survive first round, stay in hand?

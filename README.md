# Frontline

## What is Frontline
Frontline is a simple, forever free, brawler style card game. The point is to accomplish what other games like hearthstone, gwent, and runeterra in a simpler, free fashion.
Something that can be played easily and quickly with just one or two normal decks of playing cards. 

### Problems I hope to have creative solutions for
Many of the previous card games I listed above share some common problems.
1. Money, they all require some form of investment either money or time to be competitive. 
2. generally either first or second player has an advantage. Runeterra I think had a fun balancing choice for this, but the issue still mostly remained.
3. you can't really play any of them without a PC. What about magic you say? well, I know the first problem still holds true for that one.

So, I want to be clear, the above games are all great in their respective rights, and I have enjoyed them immensely.
I am just hoping to create something simpler, and more pocket sized that can be played in person with 2 to 4 players.
So here are my current solutions:
1. Should be playable with 2 standard 52 card decks, hopefully even 1. 
2. I call it frontline because I would like it to play out like two armies meeting in battle, where they each get the same information at the same time, and then have a chance to try and
respond to that new information with a resolving round after to determine the outcome. 
3. same as 1.

### Rules<sub>(very early outline, subject to change) </sub>
years of thoughts in my head i need to write down
1. Draw till certain point
2. draw support(face cards)
3. lay out lines
4. flip
5. lay out support cards face down?
